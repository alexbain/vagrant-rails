This is a template to get a Ruby on Rails app up and running in Vagrant.

Basic installation instructions:

* Download and install Virtual Box
* Download and install Vagrant
* Create a new Rails repository
* Drop the files in this repository inside the Rails repository
* ``gem install librarian``
* ``librarian-chef install``
* ``vagrant up``

I would not call this completely stable yet. If you find any bugs please report them.
